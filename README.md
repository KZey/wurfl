# The last free wurfl.xml data file

The license change of the wurfl.xml data file was announced on on August 30th, 2011 [1]
but for some reason the project's SourceForge site [2] only has a much older version than that.

I believe the version found here is the last free version of wurfl.xml, so
I'm posting it here to make sure this valuable resource doesn't get lost.

The md5 of that 2011-04-24-wurfl.xml file is 7542a6dc74c4c25b3026f94dce62489f and I got it from a file named 2011-04-24.zip 
that was previously available from the wurfl website, the md5 of that file
is 3025f981711b018cbde264524ed67c6c

Note that although (as clearly indicated in the file comments) this particular
version of wurfl.xml has a liberal license, later versions of the same file
have a different license.
